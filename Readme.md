# Arduino Uno -  PWM Output

Just a little tool to control Arduino PWM duty cycle over PC's serial monitor.

## Usage:

- Arduino PWM output is pin 3 (can be changed in code)
- Connect Arduino to PC and open Arduino, Platform IDE, ... serial monitor with baud 9600

## Controls:

Press...

- "z" for zero (0) duty cycle
- "m" for middle (125) duty cycle
- "f" for full (255) duty cycle

### &

- "u" means up and does +10 duty cycle
- "d" means down and does -10 duty cycle
